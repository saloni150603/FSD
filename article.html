        <div>When comparing the wildcat vs. domestic cat, there may not seem to be obvious similarities. 
            For most people, the term "wildcat" conjures up images of mountain lions or cheetahs, but are these animals really so different from the domestic tabby cat?  
            Get to know felis silvestris lybica, commonly known as the African Wildcat, and you'll see the likenesses are remarkable. 
            To understand these similarities, it first helps to have a brief overview of the origins of cats.

        <div>While some cats are more laid back about the space they live in, others have a territorial nature about them. This 
            quirk can, at times, prove problematic. A territorial cat might use urine marking (spraying) to indicate their territory 
            or even show signs of aggression (hissing, stalking or attacking another cat). Usually, these behaviors are prompted by a cat’s instincts. These instincts could be a fear that their access to resources (e.g., food territory) might be threatened or the instinct to challenge another cat over a potential mate.  
            If you’re wondering how to deal with a territorial cat and any cat aggression that comes with it, read on. We’ve got insights 
            and answers to help you correct this behavior.

        </div>
        <div>Although the exact reason why cats knead is the cause of much speculation, there are several 
            plausible—if not proven—theories as to why they engage in this curious activity.  
            Cats often exhibit odd behaviors their owners find equal parts puzzling and adorable. Somewhere near the top of the
            list is cat kneading. One of the most probable explanations for why cats knead is it’s an instinctive trait they’ve 
            had since kittenhood. When they’re young, kittens feed from their mother, and as they do, they often paw at and knead 
            their mother’s belly. In this instance, kneading has a purpose, as it helps to encourage milk flow from their mother’s 
            mammary glands.

        </div>
        <div>Cats primarily use three types of body language to communicate how they’re feeling: their tails, posture and ears. 
            These three indicators are often the easiest for humans to interpret. Here’s how to read your cat’s emotions through 
            body language. Fortunately, when it comes to the body language of a cat, one of the most helpful indicators is also one 
            of a cat’s most prominent features: its tail. There are times where just by looking at which way a cat’s tail is 
            pointing or how it’s moving, you’ll get an excellent idea if they want to play, cuddle or just want some space to 
            themself. While a cat’s tail can tell you a lot, it’s not the only nonverbal sign of how a cat might be feeling. 
            There’s a lot of cat body language meaning in the posture cats display. Whether it’s crouching, an arched back or 
            a purposeful, upright walk, cat posture can give important clues.
