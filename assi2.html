<h2> Here are some cat breed </h2>
<navbar>
  <div>Cat, (Felis catus), domesticated member (felid) of the family Felidae. The family is generally divided between cats from the
    subfamily Pantherinae, which roar (including lions, tigers, and leopards), and cats from the subfamily Felinae, which purr instead 
    (including cougars, bobcats, and domestic cats). According to the latest research, purring likely stems from a special pad 
    within the folds of a cat’s vocal cords, which adds an additional layer of fatty tissue that enables the folds to vibrate 
    (purr) at low frequencies. Domestic cats are characterized by retractable claws, powerful bodies, acute senses, long tails,
    and specialized teeth adapted for hunting prey.

      Younger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_cat">Bombays</a> are active, curious cats and adapt very easily to change. At any age, they love to look at the world around them and their favorite
       place may often turn out to be a window where they can observe the world outside. These cats are very affectionate and will, at times, demand time with 
       their parents.

      The Bombay is well known for jumping on a person's lap and spreading her beautiful body across the newspaper the person is reading. 
      However, as they get older, some Bombays can tend to become a bit too placid, preferring to watch rather than get involved in activities.
  </div>
  <div>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birman">Birman</a> is a more private breed and tends to attach herself to one person. Some Birmans can show a bit of jealousy if their parent 
      does not pay attention to them. While they are territorial, they are not aggressive. Being a larger cat and somewhat stocky to begin with, 
      Birmans can become overweight. Daily exercise can help keep her in good physical condition.
      In addition, groom your Birman daily to prevent matting of the fine fur.
      The Temple of Lao-Tsun was built in Asia for the worship of the goddess Tsun-Kyan-Kse. She was a golden goddess with sapphire blue eyes. Mun-Ha, one of the 
      priests of the temple, would kneel before the statue of the goddess with the white temple cat named Sinh sitting beside him. One night, raiders came into 
      to the temple as Mun-Ha was worshipping and killed him. As Mun-Ha was dying, Sinh put his feet on Mun-Ha and faced the goddess. His body immediately turned 
      from white to gold, and his eyes turned blue, just like those of the goddess. His legs turned brown, but where his feet touched his master, they remained 
      white as a symbol of purity. All the other cats in and around the temple also changed in this way. Sinh stayed with his master for the next seven days 
      when he too died, and Sinh carried the soul of Mun-Ha to paradise. To this day, it is believed that whenever one of the sacred temple cats dies, the 
      soul of a priest accompanies the soul of the cat to paradise.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Curl">American Curls</a> are friendly, affectionate, and active cats that are often said to have a somewhat "doglike" attachment to their owners. 
        They like to gently poke and prod their humans with their paws and will often follow their favorite family members from room to room around 
        the house. They are exceptionally intelligent cats as well. Some have been known to figure out how to flick light switches on and off, and 
        many learn how to open and close doors and cupboards.
        They typically retain a kitten-like playfulness throughout their entire lives and love to play with toys, climb and explore furniture and 
        cat trees, investigate anything new brought into the home, and even play fetch. However, once playtime is over, your American Curl is likely 
        to cuddle up on your lap, give you some affectionate head bumps, and spend some time in peaceful companionship. It's important to note, however,
         that American Curls don't like to be left alone for too long—so you might have to consider whether your schedule can accommodate several hours 
         of attention and playtime each day. These friendly felines aren't too large when fully grown, although they are somewhat muscular for their 
         small-to-medium size. They generally reach maturity by one to two years of age. American Curls aren't especially talkative cats, tending 
         towards quiet trills rather than loud meows. A sociable cat, most American Curls take readily to children and other pets in the home, especially 
         if they offer extra opportunities for play and fun.

        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_cat">Balinese</a>, also known as Javanese depending on coat color and pattern, is regal and aristocratic in appearance, but a curious kitten 
        at heart. This breed may appear to be the picture of refinement, but in this elegant body beats the heart of a kitten who loves to have fun. 
        Balinese and Javanese adore people, and want to be with their people. This makes them wonderful companions for those who have the time and 
        desire to appreciate this most intelligent, entertaining companion.Balinese and Javanese are talkative, similar to the Siamese. They are 
        extroverts who get along well with children and other four-legged family members. A Siamese in every nature except for their medium length, 
        silky coat, the Balinese and Javanese also have a distinctive, luxurious tail plume. This long, slender cat is lithe but muscular, with a 
        Siamese-style head, blue eyes and large, triangular ears. The generally accepted explanation for the origin of this breed is a natural 
        mutation for long hair in the Siamese cat breed. In fact, this coat length is the primary difference between the Balinese and Siamese.
        Although longhaired Siamese kittens had certainly been making occasional appearances in litters, the first real breeding program for 
        this breed didn’t begin until the 1950s.

        One look at them and you’ll be charmed! Apart from their impressive looks, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese">Burmese cat</a> 
        is friendly and social, as well as highly clever 
        so if you’re looking for a cat that can easily mesh into most families, this breed is perfect for you. Glossy and athletic, the Burmese is a 
        solid, muscular cat with a sweet expression, neat round paws, and a short coat. The eyes are large and round, the face has a hint of the exotic 
        Asian breeds, but is unexaggerated and attractive. Curious, clever, and friendly, the Burmese cat is described as having a sweet expression in 
        the breed standard, and has a nature to match if raised and socialised well. Very playful and engaging, the Burmese will learn to retrieve toys, 
        and will delight in playing with their family. This curious and inquisitive nature can land them in trouble, as they will explore every open 
        doorway, be it into another room or into a car or delivery van! Personable and sociable with family and visitors, the Burmese will enjoy attention
        and will let you know if there isn’t sufficient attention paid to them!
